I've been a big admirer of really nice personal websites and blogs. It's a playground to experiment and express as freely as your imagination allows. 
<br>
<br>
Creating a personal blog website to write personal thoughts, show design concepts and experiment with web development in general has been on my mind for quite a while now.
<br>
<br>
I've been working with my team to build and scale our design agency, [wiserstudio](https://www.wiser.studio/). With all the client work and daily to-do's I felt like having something to continuously tinker with would help me mentally and professionally too (quite obvious).

At the moment this website is quite light, running on Eleventy, Tailwind and AlpineJS. In the future I plan to develop it further to experiment with interesting layouts and interactions containing interesting insights and thoughts on design, tech and everything else I can think of.
<br>
<br>
One weakness I confess to is, that I'm not a very consistent person. I usually end up moving onto something else or get a little frustrated and drop it. So i think this first blog post is sort of like the starting line to working to make myslef more consistent.

So, I guess this is it for the first blog post. If you're one of the very few people interested in exploring my thoughts and insights, be sure to come back again later.
